**2024/12/30** - Important Bug Fixes and Major Changes.

## SKILL TREE:
- Remade the weapon swap to save 1 point and used the leftover point to take "Ingenuity" (no idea why I didn’t do this earlier).
- Changed **Essence Infusion (WPN1)** → **Potent Incantation (WPN1)** for an overall damage increase of ~6-10%.
- Used the last 2 points from **WPN2** to take **Increased Skill Effect** (in the new left line), providing more effect duration for **WPN2** skills, meaning your **Curse** and **Sigil** will stay on the map longer.

## SKILL GEMS:
- **Frost Bomb** was entirely <u>removed</u> as it wasted too much time during boss fights since you had to cast **Sigil**, **Curse**, **Frost Wall**, **Frostbolt**, and also **Frost Bomb**. Additionally, those wanting more damage had to use **Flame Wall**, which is <u>no longer required.</u>
- **Frost Wall** now replaces **Icicle** and **Concentrated Effect** with <u>**Lightning Exposure** and **"Strip Away"**</u> Support Gems. The **"Strip Away"** gem must be equipped last, as the 5th gem.
- **Hypothermia** was nerfed in the build because **Archmage** converts a lot of the damage to Lightning (around ~70% Lightning and only 30% Cold of the actual skill). <u>Focus will now be more on **Conductivity**</u>, but **Hypothermia** will still be used for additional resistance removal for the 30% Cold damage to deal more damage. You don’t really need to use **Hypothermia** anymore, as it’s no longer required.
- As we start using **Conductivity** as our main curse and **Hypothermia** as an additional curse, we will take **Whispers of Doom** as our 93-level-up skill point (not required if you’re too lazy to use an additional curse on bosses).

## BUILD PAGE:
- Modified the information under **Skills** and **Supports** in the build page.
